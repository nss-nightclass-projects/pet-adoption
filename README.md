# Project Name
Welcome to the Pet Adoption Site!

you can go to the site here:
https://cm-pet-adoption.netlify.app/

## Description
You can look at a variety of animals that are available for adoption. If you want to narrow your search, you can click the dog, cat, or dino buttons in order to show just those animals on the page. If you want to go back to seeing all the animals, just click the see-all button.

This site is able to filter animals for adoption based on what type of animal they are: dog, cat or dino.

## Features
Adoption cards are created on the DOM, and can be filtered to show only the desired animal cards by a listener event for each button.
